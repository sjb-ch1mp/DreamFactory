{"title":"The Curse of Whitcombe Manor","introduction":"You hold an envelope in your hand. On its front, in beautiful archaic calligraphy, are written the words ‘To the content creator of the YouTube channel Towards The Light’. The envelope bears no other addressee details, such as name or address, but you nonetheless conclude that its contents must be intended for you as you are indeed the owner of that channel. You notice that there is no postage stamp. A hand-delivered, hand written letter in this day and age? And how did the sender find your address? Your interest is piqued. You turn it over to see if there's a sender. 'Doctor Hawthorne Whitcombe the second', you read aloud. 'Whitecombe Manor, 101 Herald Lane.' You've never heard the name before. You open the envelope and pull out a pristine sheet of white paper. The top of the page bears a large and elaborate coat of arms that, for some reason, you find mildly unsettling. You hold the page up to the light and try in vain to make sense of the image. There appears to be an altar of some kind and what is perhaps a blade between the feet of monolithic columns. The background of the coat of arms is a large black circle with some suggestion of depth in the shading. A pit, perhaps, or a cave? You shrug and begin to read. \r\n\r\n'Dear Towards The Light, Thank you for taking the time to read my correspondence as I know your time is precious. I’m sure you must have questions about how I managed to locate your residence. Let me assure you that I do not bear you any ill will; I am simply a well-educated man of significant means and this comes in handy when I have my ambitions set on a particular goal. As a medical practitioner and surgeon, I have had much exposure to death and share your sentiments on the subject. I have been following your YouTube channel for quite some time and greatly enjoy your humorous attempts to find definitive proof of life beyond death. If you’ll forgive the pun, I have noted in your recent content a growing frustration and disillusionment at how difficult it is to find the elusive final nail in the coffin. In the hopes of reinvigorating your determination, I would therefore like to extend an invitation to my home and medical practice at Whitcombe Manor. It is here that you will find undeniable proof of the paranormal. It is here that your well-founded beliefs in an afterlife will be confirmed. Please arrive at the manor at 6pm sharp, tomorrow evening. My butler, Mr. Jacobson, will meet you at the entrance. You can find the address on the back side of the envelope. Respectfully yours, Lord Whitcombe.”\r\n\r\nThe following day you drive to the provided address and find yourself before a tall black iron gate flanked by formidable walls of cobbled stone and mortar. There is an intercom beside the driveway, but before you can press the button to notify the household of your arrival, there is a loud screech of metal and the gates open. As you enter the property, you notice a small guardhouse to your right, where a grizzled man in a dark uniform sits with his legs resting on a small desk. He is cradling an automatic weapon on his lap and takes a long draw on a cigarette as you pass by slowly, appearing completely uninterested in your presence. You drive down a long gravel driveway that splits an arbour of lush pine trees and stop your car in front of the manor. It is smaller than you expected, given the grand entrance to the property, but it is nonetheless beautiful. The bold façade of weathered brick is covered in creeping vines and the tall, thin windows are like gloomy sentinels of glass. The main doors are a pair of heavy, blood red slabs of timber with intricate carvings. To their left you see a bronze plaque that reads ‘Whitcombe Manor’.  \r\n\r\nYou turn off your engine and approach the door. As your shoe touches the bottom step, the main doors swing open. Standing in the dimly lit foyer within is an unusually tall man with a gaunt pale face like a white tombstone. He is wearing a sharply pressed suit and bowtie. You freeze in a moment of uncertainty, but he bows low and then takes a step back to invite you in. “Good evening, master” he says. “I regret to inform you that Doctor Whitcombe had urgent business to attend to and will not be able to meet with you until tomorrow morning. If you wish, we have prepared dinner for you in the dining hall.” With some embarrassment you explain that you have already eaten. The butler nods his head briefly and gestures to the wide staircase at the other end of the foyer. “Then I shall escort you to your quarters, sir.” You follow the butler up the stairs and wish that there was more illumination in the building. Your attention is drawn to the shapes of broad paintings on the walls but their details are hidden in shadow. The only source of light in the huge space is a grand chandelier with candles, most of which are unlit. You arrive at the top of the flight of red carpeted stairs and after a short walk down an equally gloomy hallway, the butler gestures to an open door. “Your room, sir” he says. You thank him and head inside. The door closes softly behind you and you are left alone. You realise that you’ve left your bag in your car, but you suddenly feel like you don’t have the strength to return downstairs. There is a heaviness in the room that washes over you and you’re struck with a fatigue that you can’t resist. With your last ounce of strength you stumble to the four-post bed in the centre of the room and collapse on the soft covers. The fatigue feels like it’s settling into your bones and you note an inexplicable sense of illness and dread, like the floor is opening up beneath you to exhale the rot of the ocean depths. In a cloud of nausea, you fall into a deep sleep.","initial_hero_stats":{"health":100,"attack_power":1,"defence":1},"rooms":[{"index":0,"name":"NIGHTMARE","description":"You are tumbling down an immense pit that seems to go forever, the walls of which are writhing with strange grey limbs, rolling eyes and beastly gnashing mouths.

The ground feels like wet sand beneath your feet and you are surrounded by an almost imperceptibly low rumble, punctuated by distant crashing waves and the unnaturally loud sound of water dripping from the jagged stalactites above. You feel as if you’re being watched from the darkness by a multitude of unearthly creatures twisted by eons of madness and hunger.","passages":[{"direction":"EAST","index":0},{"direction":"WEST","index":1},{"direction":"SOUTH","index":2},{"direction":"NORTH","index":3}],"characters":[0],"enemies":[1,2,3,4],"containers":[],"is_final_room":false},{"index":1,"name":"GUARDHOUSE","description":"You close the door behind you as you enter the guardhouse.
